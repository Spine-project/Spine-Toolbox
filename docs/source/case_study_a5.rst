Case Study A5 tutorial
**********************

Welcome to Spine Toolbox's Case Study A5 tutorial.
Case Study A5 is one of the Spine Project case studies designed to verify
Toolbox and Model capabilities.
To this end, it *reproduces* an already existing study about hydropower
on the `Skellefte river <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellefte_River>`_,
which models one week of operation of the fifteen power stations
along the river.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to run Case Study A5 on Spine Toolbox
and is organized as follows:

Introduction
------------

Model assumptions
=================

For each power station in the river, the following information is known:

- The capacity, or maximum electricity output. This datum also provides the maximum water discharge
  as per the efficiency curve (see next point).
- The efficiency curve, or conversion rate from water to electricity.
  In this study, a piece-wise linear efficiency with two segments is assumed.
  Moreover, this curve is monotonically decreasing, i.e., the efficiency in the first segment is strictly greater
  than the efficiency in the second segment.
- The maximum magazine level, or amount of water that can be stored in the reservoir.
- The magazine level at the beginning of the simulation period, and at the end.
- The minimum amount of water that the plant needs to discharge at every hour.
  This is usually zero (except for one of the plants).
- The minimum amount of water that needs to be *spilled* at every hour.
  Spilled water does not go through the turbine and thus does not serve to produce electricity;
  it just helps keeping the magazine level at bay.
- The downstream plant, or next plant in the river course.
- The time that it takes for the water to reach the downstream plant.
  This time can be different depending on whether the water is discharged (goes through the turbine) or spilled.
- The local inflow, or amount of water that naturally enters the reservoir at every hour.
  In this study, it is assumed constant over the entire simulation period.
- The hourly average water discharge. It is assumed that before the beginning of the simulation,
  this amount of water has constantly been discharged at every hour.

The system is operated so as to maximize total profit over the week,
while respecting capacity constraints, maximum magazine level constrains, and so on.
Hourly profit per plant is simply computed as the product of the electricity price and the production,
minus a penalty for changes on the water discharge in two consecutive hours.
This penalty is computed as the product of a constant penalty factor, common to all plants,
and the absolute value of the difference in discharge with respect to the previous hour.

Modelling choices
=================

The model of the electric system is fairly simple, only two elements are needed:

- A common electricity node.
- A load unit that takes electricity from that node.

On the contrary, the model of the river system is more detailed.
Each power station in the river is modelled using the following elements:

- An upper water node, located at the entrance of the station.
- A lower water node, located at the exit of the station.
- A reservoir unit, that takes water from the upper node to put it into a water storage and viceversa.
- A power plant unit, that discharges water from the upper node into the lower node,
  and feeds electricity produced in the process to the common electricity node.
- A spillway connection, that takes spilled water from the upper node and releases it to the downstream upper node.
- A discharge connection, that takes water from the lower node and releases it to the downstream upper node.

Below is a schematic of the model. For clarity, only the Rebnis station is presented in full detail:

Guide
-----

Installing requirements
=======================

Make sure that Spine Toolbox and julia 1.2 (or greater) are properly installed
as described at the following links:

- `Running Spine Toolbox <https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox#running-spine-toolbox>`_
- `Julia downloads <https://julialang.org/downloads/>`_

Setting up project
==================

Each Spine Toolbox project resides in its own directory. In this directory the user 
can collect all data, programming scripts and other material needed for the project. 
The Toolbox application also creates its own special subdirectory ".spinetoolbox", 
for project settings etc.

#. Launch Spine Toolbox and from the main menu, select **File -> New project...** 
   to create a new project. Browse to a location where you want to create the project
   and create a new folder for it, e.g. "Case Study A5".

#. Drag the Data Store icon (|ds_icon|) from the toolbar and drop it into the 
   *Design View*. This will open the *Add Data Store* dialog. 
   Type "input" as the Data Store name and click **Ok**.

#. Repeat the above operation to create a Data Store called "output".

#. Drag the Tool icon (|tool_icon|) from the toolbar and drop it into the 
   *Design View*. This will open the *Add Tool* dialog. Type "SpineOpt" as 
   the Tool name and click **Ok**.

   .. note:: Each item in the *Design view* is equipped with three *connectors*
      (the small squares at the item boundaries).

#. Click on one of "input" connectors and then on one of "SpineOpt" connectors. 
   This will create a *connection* from the former to the latter.

#. Repeat the procedure to create a *connection* from "SpineOpt" to "output". 
   It should look something like this:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_item_connections.png
      :align: center

#. From the main menu, select **File -> Save project**.


Setting up SpineOpt
===================

Get the *SpineOpt* Julia package from our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl>`_.
You can either clone the source code with Git or download it as a zip package.
Put the source files in directory "SpineOpt.jl" under your project directory.

   .. note:: Spine Toolbox version 0.5 supports SpineOpt up to 
             `version 0.4.4 <https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl/tree/v0.4.4>`_. 


Configuring Julia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to Spine Toolbox main window and select **File -> Settings...**. This will 
   open the *Settings* dialog.

#. Go to the *Tools* page and enter the path to your julia executable path or 
   leave blank to use the executable in your PATH.

#. Create a new sub directory ".julia" under your project directroy and select 
   that as the Julia project to use (the second line edit under Julia section).

#. Click **Ok**.

#. From the application main menu, select **File -> Tool configuration assistant**. 
   This will install the `SpineOpt package <https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl>`_
   to the julia project specified above. Follow the instructions until completion.

Entering input data
===================

Creating input database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Follow the steps below to create a new Spine database for SpineOpt in the 
   'input' Data Store:

   #. Select the 'input' Data Store item in the *Design View*.
   #. Go to *Data Store Properties* and hit **New Spine db**.

#. Still in *Data Store Properties*, click **Open editor**. This will open 
   the newly created database in the *Spine database editor*, looking similar to this:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_treeview_empty.png
      :align: center

   |

   .. note:: The *Spine database editor* is a dedicated interface within Spine Toolbox
      for visualizing and managing Spine databases.

Creating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Follow the steps below to add power plants to the model as objects of class ``unit``:

   #. Go to *Object tree*,
      right-click on ``unit`` and select **Add objects** from the context menu. This will
      open the *Add objects* dialog.
   #. With your mouse, select the list of plant names from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

      .. _pwr_plant_names:

      ::
