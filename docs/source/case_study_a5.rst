Case Study A5 Tutorial
**********************

Welcome to Spine Toolbox's Case Study A5 tutorial.
Case Study A5 is one of the Spine Project case studies designed to verify
Toolbox and Model capabilities.
To this end, it *reproduces* an already existing study about hydropower
on the `Skellefte river <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skellefte_River>`_,
which models one week of operation of the fifteen power stations
along the river.

In this tutorial we first introduce some key aspects of the model and then provide 
a step-by-step guide on how to build a workflow, which includes building a model.
Finally, we execute the workflow and examine the results. 
The tutorial is organized as follows:

Spine Installation
-------------------

.. note:: This tutorial is written for `Spine Toolbox 
   <https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox/>`_ and `SpineOpt 
   <https://github.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl>`_ development version on |Revised|.
   If you are using a later version, the steps in this setup guide may be outdated.   

#. Install Spine Toolbox as described in `installing-spine-toolbox 
   <https://github.com/Spine-project/Spine-Toolbox#installing-spine-toolbox>`_.

#. Download and install Julia 1.5 (or greater) as described `here <https://julialang.org/downloads/>`_.

#. Install SpineOpt: Launch Spine Toolbox and select
   **File -> Tool configuration assistants... -> SpineOpt.jl** from the main menu.   
   
   
About the Model
----------------

Model Assumptions
=================

For each power station in the river, the following information is known:

- The capacity, or maximum electricity output. This datum also provides the maximum water discharge
  as per the efficiency curve (see next point).
- The efficiency curve, or conversion rate from water to electricity.
  In this study, a piece-wise linear efficiency with two segments is assumed.
  Moreover, this curve is monotonically decreasing, i.e., the efficiency in the first segment is strictly greater
  than the efficiency in the second segment.
- The maximum magazine level, or amount of water that can be stored in the reservoir.
- The magazine level at the beginning of the simulation period, and at the end.
- The minimum amount of water that the plant needs to discharge at every hour.
  This is usually zero (except for one of the plants).
- The minimum amount of water that needs to be *spilled* at every hour.
  Spilled water does not go through the turbine and thus does not serve to produce electricity;
  it just helps keeping the magazine level at bay.
- The downstream plant, or next plant in the river course.
- The time that it takes for the water to reach the downstream plant.
  This time can be different depending on whether the water is discharged (goes through the turbine) or spilled.
- The local inflow, or amount of water that naturally enters the reservoir at every hour.
  In this study, it is assumed constant over the entire simulation period.
- The hourly average water discharge. It is assumed that before the beginning of the simulation,
  this amount of water has constantly been discharged at every hour.

The system is operated so as to maximize total profit over the week,
while respecting capacity constraints, maximum magazine level constrains, and so on.
Hourly profit per plant is simply computed as the product of the electricity price and the production,
minus a penalty for changes on the water discharge in two consecutive hours.
This penalty is computed as the product of a constant penalty factor, common to all plants,
and the absolute value of the difference in discharge with respect to the previous hour.


Modelling Choices
=================

The model of the electric system is fairly simple, only two elements are needed:

- A common electricity node.
- A load unit that takes electricity from that node.

On the contrary, the model of the river system is more detailed.
Each power station in the river is modelled using the following elements:

- An upper water node, located at the entrance of the station.
- A lower water node, located at the exit of the station.
- A power plant unit, that discharges water from the upper node into the lower node,
  and feeds electricity produced in the process to the common electricity node.
- A spillway connection, that takes spilled water from the upper node and releases it to the downstream upper node.
- A discharge connection, that takes water from the lower node and releases it to the downstream upper node.

Below is a schematic of the model. For clarity, only the Rebnis station is presented in full detail:

Building the Workflow
------------------------------------

Start Spine Toolbox
=========================

Launching the program opens the `Spine Toolbox Main Window`_ that can be seen below. 

..  _Spine Toolbox Main Window:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_main_window.png
         :align: center

The blue bar that starts with the word *Items* is called the tool bar. Some names for the 
different windows inside Spine Toolbox that we may refer to can be seen in the picture, e.g. *Design view*. 


Create a New Project
======================

Each Spine Toolbox project resides in its own directory, where the user 
can store data, programming scripts and other material needed for the project. 
The Toolbox application also creates its own special subdirectory *.spinetoolbox*, 
for project settings, etc.

To create a new project, select **File -> New project...** from Spine Toolbox main menu.
Browse to a location where you want to create the project and create a new folder for it,
called e.g. **Case Study A5**, and then click **Open**.


Configure SpineOpt 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To use SpineOpt in your project, you need to create a Tool specification for it.
   Click on the small arrow next to the Tool icon |tool_icon| (in the *Items* section of the tool bar),
   and select **Create new Tool Specification...** from the drop-down menu.
   The `Tool Specificaiton Editor`_ form will popup.

#. Type **SpineOpt** as the name of the specification and select **Julia** as the type.
   Unselect **Execute in work directory**. 

#. Click on |new| (marked with a red square in the image below) to create a new Julia file.
   Enter a file name, e.g. **run_spineopt.jl**, and click **Save**.

#. Back in the `Tool Specificaiton Editor`_ form, you should now see a small text editor
   with the legend *Create main program file here...*
   Go ahead and enter the following text in it: 

   .. code-block:: julia

      using SpineOpt
      run_spineopt(ARGS...)

#. In order to save the changes in the main program file that you just typed, you need to 
   click |save| (marked with a blue circle in the image below), see `Tool Specificaiton Editor`_.  
   Then click on **Ok** to save the data in the specification form, which closes the window.   

   ..  _Tool Specificaiton Editor:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_tool_specification_editor_1.png
         :align: center
            

Setup Project and Create Databases
==========================================

#. From the tool bar, drag the Data Store icon |ds_icon| and drop it into the 
   *Design View*. This will open the *Add Data Store* dialog. 
   Type **input** as the Data Store name and click **Ok**.

#. Repeat the above operation to create a Data Store called **output**.

#. In the tool bar, click on the small arrow next to the Tool icon |tool_icon| and drag the **SpineOpt**
   item from the drop-down menu into the *Design View*.
   This will open the *Add Tool* dialog. Type **SpineOpt** as the Tool name and click **Ok**.

#. In the *Design view*, click on an `Item Connector`_  of **input** and then on an `Item Connector`_ of **SpineOpt**. 
   This will create a *connection* from the former to the latter.

#. Repeat the procedure to create a *connection* from **SpineOpt** to **output**. 

#. In the *Design view* select data store **input** and you should see the `Data Store Properties`_ window
   (on the right side of the window, usually). From Data Store Properties window select Dialect **sqllite** and 
   click button **New Spine db** and from the pop-up window click **Save**.     

#. Repeat the steps in the previous step, but now for data store **output**.

#. In the *Design view* select the **SpineOpt** Tool to show the `Tool Properties`_ 
   (on the right side of the window, usually). You should see two elements 
   listed under *Available resources*, **{db_url@input}** and **{db_url@output}**.

#. Drag the first resource, **{db_url@input}**, and drop it in *Command line arguments*.
   
#. Drag the second resource,  **{db_url@output}**, and drop it right below the previous one.
   The panel should be now looking similar to the picture `Tool Properties`_.

#. From the main menu, select **File -> Save project**.

..  _Data Store Properties:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_spine_data_store_properties.png

..  _Tool Properties:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_spine_tool_properties.png 
      :align: center        
      

Enter Input Data
===================

Import SpineOpt Database Template 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the steps below to load a database template for SpineOpt in the 
*input* Data Store:

#. Download `the SpineOpt database template 
   <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spine-project/SpineOpt.jl/master/data/spineopt_template.json>`_.

#. Select the **input** Data Store item in the *Design View*.

#. Go to *Data Store Properties* and click **Open editor**. This will open 
   the empty database in the `Spine DataBase editor`_ .
   
#. To open the `Spine DataBase`_  Main Menu, click on the context menu icon |db_menu| in the top 
   right corner of Spine DB editor window. Select **File -> Import...**,
   and then select the template file you previously downloaded. Observe that file type you 
   just downloaded is .json and that we need select to view .json types of files.   
   The contents of that file will be imported into the current database,
   and you should then see classes like *commodity*, *connection* and *model* under 
   the root node in the *Object tree* (on the left).

#. From the main menu, select **Session -> Commit**.
   Enter *Import SpineOpt Database Template* as message in the popup dialog, and click **Commit**.
   
..  _Spine DataBase:

   .. image:: img/case_study_a5_spine_db_load_template.png
      :align: center


Add Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To add power plants to the model, add objects of class *unit* as follows:

   a. Select the list of plant names from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

   b. Go to *Object tree* (on the top left of the window, usually),
      right-click on ``unit`` and select **Add objects** from the context menu. This will
      open the *Add objects* dialog.

   c. Select the first cell under the **object name** column
      and press **Ctrl+V**. This will paste the list of plant names from the clipboard into that column;
      the **object class name** column will be filled automatically with *unit*.
      The form should now be looking similar to this:

        .. image:: img/add_power_plant_units.png
          :align: center

.. _Specify Object Parameter Values:


Specify Object Parameter Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To specify the general behaviour of our model, enter *model parameter values* as follows:

   a. From the object tree select ``model`` and go to *Object parameter value* window (on top-center of `Spine DataBase`_ window).
      Make sure that the columns in the table are ordered as follows:
      
   .. tabularcolumns:: |l|c|p{5cm}|

   +-----------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+-----+--------+
   |object_class_name|object_name|parameter_name|alternative_name|value|database|
   +-----------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+-----+--------+

   b. Select the model parameter value data from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

      .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-model-parameter-values.txt

   c. Select the first empty cell under *object_class_name* and press **Ctrl+V**.
      This will paste the model parameter value data from the clipboard into the table.
      The form should be looking like this:

      .. image:: img/case_study_a5_model_parameters.png
            :align: center

#. To specify the resolution of our ``temporal_block``, repeat the same procedure with the data below:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-temporal_block-parameter-values.txt

#. To specify the behaviour of all system nodes, i.e. ``node`` block, repeat the same procedure with the data below:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-node-parameter-values.txt

   The *parameter_name* descriptions for system nodes are given below:
   
   a. *demand* represents the local inflow (negative in most cases).
   b. *fix_node_state* represents fixed reservoir levels (at the beginning and the end).
   c. *has_state* indicates whether or not the node is a reservoir (true for all the upper nodes).
   d. *state_coeff* is the reservoir *efficienty* (always 1, meaning that there aren't any loses).
   e. *node_state_cap* is the maximum level of the reservoirs.

#. Commit changes with the message *Specify Object Parameter Values*.

.. _Establish Relationships:


Establish Relationships
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. To establish that (i) power plant units receive water from 
   the station's upper node, and (ii) the electricity load unit takes electricity from the common
   electricity node, create relationships of class *unit__from_node* as follows:

   a. Select the list of unit and node names from the text-box below
      and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**).

      .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__from_node.txt

   b. Go to *Relationship tree* (on the bottom left of `Spine DataBase`_ window),
      right-click on ``unit__from_node``
      and select **Add relationships** from the context menu. This will
      open the *Add relationships* dialog.

   c. Select the first cell under the *unit* column
      and press **Ctrl+V**. This will paste the list of plant and node names from the clipboard into the table.
      The form should be looking like this:

      .. image:: img/add_pwr_plant_water_from_node.png
        :align: center

   d. Click **Ok**.
   e. Back in the *Spine DataBase editor*, under *Relationship tree*, double click on
      **unit__from_node** to confirm that the relationships are effectively there.

#. To establish that (i) power plant units release water to the station's lower node,
   and (ii) power plant units inject electricity to the common electricity node,
   *add relationships* of class ``unit__to_node`` with the following data:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__to_node.txt

   .. note:: At this point, you might be wondering what's the purpose of the ``unit__node__node``
      relationship class. Shouldn't it be enough to have ``unit__from_node`` and ``unit__to_node`` to represent
      the topology of the system? The answer is yes; but in addition to topology, we also need to represent
      the *conversion process* that happens in the unit, where the water from one node is turned into electricty
      for another node. And for this purpose, we use a relationship parameter value on the ``unit__node__node``
      relationships (see :ref:`Specify Relationship Parameter Values`).

#. To establish that (i) discharge connections take water from the *lower* node of the upstream station,
   and (ii) spillway connections take water from the *upper* node of the upstream station,
   *add relationships* of class ``connection__from_node`` with the following data:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__from_node.txt

#. To establish that both discharge and spillway connections release water onto 
   the upper node of the downstream station, *add relationships* of class ``connection__to_node`` with the following data:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__to_node.txt

   .. note:: At this point, you might be wondering what's the purpose of the ``connection__node__node``
      relationship class. Shouldn't it be enough to have ``connection__from_node`` and ``connection__to_node``
      to represent the topology of the system? The answer is yes; but in addition to topology, we also need to represent
      the *delay* in the river branches.
      And for this purpose, we use a relationship parameter value on the ``connection__node__node``
      relationships (see :ref:`Specify Relationship Parameter Values`).


#. To establish that water nodes balance water between all upper and lower reservoir nodes and the *water* commodity; and
   that  *electricity_node* balances with *electricity* commodity. *Add relationships* of class ``node__commodity`` with the following data:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-node__commodity.txt

   
#. Next, to establish that all nodes are balanced at each time slice in the one week horizon,
   *add relationships* of class ``model__default_temporal_block`` with the following data: 
   
   .. literalinclude::   data/cs-a5-model__default_temporal_block.txt
    
#. To establish that this model is deterministic:

   a. *add relationship* of class ``model__default_stochastic_structure`` with the following data:
   
      .. literalinclude::   data/cs-a5-model__default_stochastic_structure.txt
   
   b. *add relationship* of class ``stochastic_structure__stochastic_scenario`` with the following data:

      .. literalinclude::   data/cs-a5-stochastic_structure__stochastic_scenario.txt

#. Finally, in order to write the results from running SpineOpt to the ouput database.

   a. *Add relationship* of class ``report__output`` with the following data:

	   .. literalinclude::   data/cs-a5-report__output.txt

   b. *Add relationship* of class ``model__report`` with the following data:

      .. literalinclude::   data/cs-a5-model__report.txt

#. From the main menu, select **Session -> Commit** to open the *Commit changes* dialog. Enter ‘Establish Relationships‘ as the commit message and click **Commit**.

.. _Specify Relationship Parameter Values:


Specify Relationship Parameter Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Add relationship parameter values that specify: (i) the capacity of hydro power plants, and (ii) the variable operating cost of the electricity unit (equal to the negative electricity price).

   a. Go to the *Relationship tree* and select ``unit__from_node``. In the *Relationship parameter value* (on the bottom-center of the window, usually). Make sure that the columns in the table are ordered as follows:

      ::

         relationship_class_name | object_name_list | parameter_name | alternative_name | value | database

   b. Select the parameter value data from the text-box below and copy it to the clipboard (**Ctrl+C**):

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__from_node-relationship-parameter-values.txt

   c. Select the first empty cell under *relationship_class_name* and press **Ctrl+V**. This will paste the parameter value data from the clipboard into the table.
	  
#. Add relationship parameter values that specifies the conversion ratio from water to electricity and from water to water of different hydro power plants (the latter being equal to 1). Add *relationship_class_name* entries of ``unit__node__node`` by repeating the same procedure with the data below:

   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-unit__node__node-relationship-parameter-values.txt
   
#. Add relationship parameter values that specifies the average discharge and spillage in the first hours of the simulation. Add *relationship_class_name* entries of ``connection__from_node`` by repeating the same procedure with the data below:
   
   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__from_node-relationship-parameter-values.txt  
      
#. Add relationship parameter values that specifies the delay and transfer ratio of different water connections (the latter being equal to 1). Add *relationship_class_name* entries of ``connection__node__node`` by repeating the same procedure with the data below:
  
   .. literalinclude:: data/cs-a5-connection__node__node-relationship-parameter-values.txt 
  
#. From the main menu, select **Session -> Commit** to open the *Commit changes* dialog. Enter *Specify Relationship Parameter Values* as the commit message and click **Commit**.

#. Close `Spine DataBase editor`_ .


Workflow Result 
----------------

Execute Workflow
======================

Once the workflow is defined and input data is in place, the project is ready
to be executed. Hit the **Execute project** button |execute_project| on 
the tool bar.

You should see ‘Executing All Directed Acyclic Graphs’ printed in the *Event log*
(on the lower left by default). 
SpineOpt output messages will appear in the *Process Log* panel in the middle.
After some processing, *DAG 1/1 completed successfully* appears and the 
execution is complete, see `Workflow execution`_.
